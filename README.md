# Fizzbuzzbuilder

Package for building fizzbuzz components using custom logic

## Installation

Currently the only way this package can be used is by cloning on github.
This package is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in
production. However, I can't think of any production use case for fizzbuzz.
